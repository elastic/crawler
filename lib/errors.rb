  # Raised only if the queue item added somehow overflows the queue threshold.
  # The queue threshold is checked before an item is added so this error shouldn't occur.
  # If this error occurs, something is wrong with the interaction between the Elasticsearch sink and BulkQueue.
  class BulkQueueOverflowError < StandardError; end

  # Raised when attempting to add a crawl result to the sink, but it is currently locked.
  # This is specific for Elasticsearch sink. Basically the sink is single-threaded but
  # receives crawl results from multi-threaded processes. This error is raised to prevent
  # overloading the queue if Elasticsearch indexing is failing repeatedly and performing
  # exponential backoff. This error should be treated as retryable.
